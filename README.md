Original Design
===============

This assignment is similar to the previous assignment. You may find the PowerPoint sides 67 to 141 of the [apjava1.pptx](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bz2ZkT6qWPYTVkF4Q19aZ3dfdk0) presentation helpful. Start by logging into GitHub and forking [this](https://github.com/LowellSampleClass/OriginalDesign) repository.  

Now, modify the Java code in the `OriginalDesign.pde` file to create your own design using the Processing graphics functions. Your program should use a variety of the [Processing graphics functions](https://processing.org/reference/). You will also
define four functions:  
`void setup()`  
`void draw()`  
and at least two of your own 

You will also need to modify `index.html` to personalize the title, header and footer. Have fun and be creative! Your design doesn't have to look like anyone else's.
